# 🚦 YJS WebRTC Signalling Server(LICENSED BY MIT)

Welcome to the **WebRTC Signalling Server** 👋  
This project powers real-time communication between clients in a collaborative code editor, enabling seamless peer-to-peer connections using WebRTC technology.

## ✨ Features
- 🛜 **Real-Time Collaboration:** Instantly connect users for live code editing.
- 📡 **Efficient Signalling:** Lightweight signalling server using WebSocket for quick exchange of SDP and ICE candidates.
- 🔐 **Secure & Scalable:** Designed for reliability and security in production environments.

## 🏗️ How It Works
The signalling server acts as a middleman, helping clients discover each other and coordinate WebRTC connections. Once connected, clients communicate directly for fast, low-latency collaboration.
